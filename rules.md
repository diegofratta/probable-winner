# X-Team 58 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will create a list of tasks that need to be done, people can volunteer for certain tasks.
Not all tasks will be equally difficult, once someone finishes their task, they can move onto a new
one or help someone else on their task.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will put group deadlines for tasks and communicate through our GroupMe chat when we finish a task or
need assistance with a task.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will let people know immediatly if a task appears to be challenging to avoid a build up of work
and to have more time to complete the task.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will have check-ins in our group chat about everyone's tasks.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

We will all be team players, never afraid to ask for help or give help to each other.
